## 8) Troubleshooting (Most Common Issues)

### A) Login & Access
- **Forgot password / 2FA:** Use *Forgot Password*; check spam for OTPs.  
- **SSO enabled but failing:** Confirm IdP cert/ACS URL; contact IT/admin.  
- **Account locked:** 3 failed attempts → 10-minute lock; admin can unlock in *Settings ▸ Team.*

### B) Billing & Invoices
- **Charged twice:** Share **last 4 digits**, **date/time**, **amount**, and **invoice #** → **billing@techcorp.ng**; we verify and **refund** duplicates.  
- **Need invoice copy:** *Settings ▸ Billing ▸ Invoices* (download PDF).  
- **Switch monthly ⇄ annual:** *Settings ▸ Billing ▸ Plan* (annual saves 20%).  
- **Change card / add method:** *Settings ▸ Billing ▸ Payment Methods*.

### C) Payments (Paystack/Flutterwave)
- **Card declined:** Try another card, check 3-D Secure, verify funds.  
- **USSD/bank transfer pending:** Allow **up to 24 hours**; send proof if urgent.  
- **VAT on invoices:** Enabled automatically for NG entities; ensure business details in *Settings ▸ Billing.*

### D) API & Integrations
- **429 “Too Many Requests”:** Backoff + batch requests + caching; consider plan upgrade.  
- **401 “Unauthorized”:** Regenerate token, check scopes/expiry.  
- **Webhooks not arriving:** Verify endpoint URL, SSL cert, firewall; check logs in *Settings ▸ Integrations ▸ Webhooks.*

### E) Dashboards & Data
- **No data showing:** Confirm integration auth, source permissions, and date filters.  
- **Timezone/currency off:** *Settings ▸ Regional* → **WAT/NGN**.  
- **Slow charts:** Reduce date ranges, pre-aggregate, or use cached views (Pro+).

### F) Email Deliverability
- **OTP/Invoice in spam:** Add **@techcorp.ng** to allow-list; set SPF/DKIM at your domain if using SSO/user-provisioning emails.
